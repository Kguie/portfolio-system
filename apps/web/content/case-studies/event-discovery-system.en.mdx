# Event Discovery System

A modular event discovery platform designed to help users find relevant experiences across cities and categories.

## Context

Teams needed a reliable way to aggregate events from multiple providers while keeping search and filtering fast under peak traffic.

## What I Built

- Unified ingestion pipeline for provider feeds.
- Normalization layer for taxonomy and venue metadata.
- Query-focused API for search, facets, and relevance ranking.

## Architecture Snapshot

```ts
export async function searchEvents(query: string) {
  const normalized = normalizeQuery(query);
  const results = await eventIndex.search(normalized, {
    facets: ["city", "category", "date"],
    limit: 20,
  });

  return rerankByFreshness(results);
}
```

## Outcome

The system reduced average search response times and improved content quality through consistent data normalization.
